<br>Hi there!

<p>
I am Arijit Pande, a Masters student at University of Virginia(UVa) in Computer Science. I am 
In the first two semesters, I have enrolled in the following courses - Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Cloud Computing, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Deep Learning for Computer Vision and Software Analysis and Artifacts.</p> In the summer of 2020, I will be interning as a software engineer intern at Amazon.
<p>Before joining UVa, I worked in the software industry for 4 years. I worked at Mojo Networks from 2016 to 2018 and then a year after that at Arista Networks after Arista Networks acquired Mojo.</p>

<p>Outside of work and studies, I like playing and watching football, racquetball. I also dabble a bit with nature and travelling. Sudoku solving is also a hobby that I pursue in my free time.</p>
